            <li>Separate the egg white and the egg yolk. The egg yolk you can put in the mixing bowl. Beat the egg white

            </li>
            <li>Mix everything together till it has a consistent consistency throughout. Roll the dough till it's about
                2/4mm thick, and cut out your preferred choice of shapes.</li>
            <li>Bursh the egg yol over the eggs, and sprinkle some extra sugar on top.</li>
            <li>Optional: You can add a small nut on top, or put some chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>If oven is preheated, bake the biscuits for about 10 minutes or until golden light brown in color. Let
                cool and enjoy!</li>
